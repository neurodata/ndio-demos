    "When creating a new `ndio.Remote` in a development environment, it's not uncommon to need two `ndio.Remote` servers running at different locations. For instance, if you run a production-level server at `http://neurodatafork.io` and you run a development version at `http://dev.neurodatafork.io`, you'll want two `ndio.Remotes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful in cases where you want to transfer data from one server (maybe `private.neurodatafork.io`) to another (perhaps `public.neurodatafork.io`), or when you want to compare results from development code to production code.\n",

    "In this example we'll instantiate two `ndio.Remote`s and see how to get them talking to each other.\n",

    "**Note that none of the code in this notebook is intented to be run as-is** &mdash; this uses made-up URLs to show how this is *hypothetically* possible. Oh, and if your idea of a 'private' server is just replacing the word 'public' with 'private', then you should probably consider addressing that before reading on..."
