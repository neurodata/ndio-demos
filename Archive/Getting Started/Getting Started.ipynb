    "This notebook is a brief introduction to ndio, the python library for interfacing with [neurodata](http://neurodata.io) tools, such as [m2g](http://m2g.io) or [the Open Connectome Project](http://ocp.ne). There is some awesome documentation for these tools over [at the website](http://docs.neurodata.io/nddocs/), so I won't duplicate that here. Instead, we'll take a short tour through some useful or commonly-used functions."
